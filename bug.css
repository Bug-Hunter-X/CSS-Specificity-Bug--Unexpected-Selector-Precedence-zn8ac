The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

The expected behavior is that the paragraph (`p`) element should have a red color. However, due to the specificity of CSS selectors, the first rule (`div p`) takes precedence and applies the blue color to the paragraph inside a `div` element, even if the second rule (`p`) is declared later.
