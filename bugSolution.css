The solution involves understanding and adjusting CSS specificity rules.  Here's the corrected CSS to ensure the paragraph has red color regardless of parent element:

```css
/* Specificity improved using the `!important` flag */
p {
  color: red !important;
}

div p {
  color: blue;
}

/*or*/

/* Using an extra class on paragraph to improve specificity */
.my-paragraph {
  color: red;
}

/* or improve specificity of second selector by increasing specificity */
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p.red {
  color: red;
} 
```

The `!important` flag should be used cautiously.  It's generally better to fix specificity issues by adjusting selectors.
